###Virtual Study Room Project

The Virtual Study Room project is an online collaborative platform designed to facilitate group study sessions for university students. It enables students and lecturers to host virtual study rooms on specific topics, where participants can join, engage in discussions, and share resources. The platform includes interactive features such as live chat, an interactive whiteboard for real-time explanations, a resource-sharing library, and timed study sessions with break management. Additionally, hosts can create polls for group decisions, conduct quizzes to test understanding, and provide shared notes, creating an engaging and productive virtual learning environment.
